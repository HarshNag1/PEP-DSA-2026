# 📘 CLASS WORK D1 — PEP DSA 2026

## 📖 Overview

This directory contains structured implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts as part of the PEP-DSA-2026 program.

The content is organized topic-wise to ensure systematic learning, structured revision, and strong conceptual clarity through practical coding implementations.

This repository reflects disciplined practice, consistency, and a solid foundation-building approach toward technical interviews and competitive programming.
